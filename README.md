* [ ] array accessors
* [ ] comments
* [ ] custom lexer for indentation and newlines
* [ ] JS untyped code gen / nova IR
* [ ] type annotations
* [ ] HM type inference

# Types

* [ ] Generics
* [ ] Row types
* [ ] Algebraic effects via JS yield
* [ ] Polymorphic variants
* [ ] `handle` keyword
* [ ] Overloading, maybe?

# Future

* [ ] JS stdlib
