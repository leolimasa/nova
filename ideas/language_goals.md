# Nova's goals

## Easy

Nova concepts should be intuitive to understand. The language should have few but powerful concepts. Use symbols sparingly. There should be low cognitive load to write the language - no worries about interfaces, memory layout, or other low-level details.

**Learnable in a day by a seasoned programmer.**

## Pragmatic

Nova should focus on solving real world problems as opposed to purely academic ones. It should get out of the way of the programmer. It should incentivate team collaboration and make it easy to write concurrent applications.

**Write real-world production grade programs**

## Safe

The language should prevent common errors at compile time.

**Once compiled, programs should just work.**

## Readable

The syntax should be simple with as few keywords as possible. Few symbols. Focus on consistency.

**The language should be consistent everywhere.**

## Fast

Nova should be fast, comparable in performance to Rust and Go and ideally C.

## Portable

Nova should work everywhere, from mobile devices to web browsers. Our initial targets are:

* ARM + x86 for Linux, Windows, and macOS
* ARM for iOS and Android
* Arduino microcontrollers
* WebAssembly
* JavaScript

**Write once, compile to everywhere.**
